# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a simple Etch-a-Sketch application created for study purposes. It allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over squares with different colors, including a special "Rainbow" mode. The goal is to explore JavaScript, HTML, and CSS fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Drawing Modes**: Users can choose different colors for drawing, including a "Rainbow" mode that changes the color on each hover.
- **Eraser Mode**: Users can erase parts of their drawing by selecting the "White" color.
- **Adjustable Grid Size**: The drawing grid can be resized to accommodate different numbers of squares.
- **Reset Functionality**: A button to clear the board and start fresh.
